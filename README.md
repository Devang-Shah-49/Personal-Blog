# Personal-Blog Webpage by Devang Shah
I have created a responsive website for displaying a blog about yourself.

# Files/Folders Included
* Assets - To include all images, videos, GIFs, Resume.
* CSS - To style the website, I have used Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) and linked it with the html document.
* index.html - The base of website created using HyperText Markup Language(HTML).
* Readme.md - To give a gist about what the repository contains.

# Website Elements
* Navigation Bar(Top) - To navigate through different sections(viz. Home, Skills, Likings, Contact) of the website, for adding social media accounts as contact-icons.
* Main Content(Center) - The middle of the webpage contains the contents of each section along with images, files, videos, animations.
* Footer(Bottom) - To show the author of the webpage along with the tools/techniques used for creating it.
